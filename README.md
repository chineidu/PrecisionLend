- Model training and evaluation
- Integration with core banking systems
- Continuous monitoring and refinement (retraining)
- Deployment and scaling
- User feedback and improvement

## Installations

- Install [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) by Astral.

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

- To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

```sh
# Create a new Python project (optional)
uv init

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
. .venv/bin/activate
```

- To sync the project's dependencies with the local environment, run the following command:

```sh
# Sync the project's dependencies with the local environment
uv sync

# Create a lockfile for the project's dependencies
uv lock
```

- Install `pre-commit` hooks:

```sh
uv add pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## ZenML Integrations

### Useful Commands

```sh
# Start the ZenML dashboard locally.
zenml up

# Stop the ZenML dashboard
zenml down

# Downgrade zenml version in global config.
zenml downgrade

# Download and purge the local database and re-initialize the global configuration to bring it back to its default factory state
zenml downgrade && zenml clean

# show the ZenML dashboard.
zenml show
```

- It is assmumed that you have [ZenML](https://zenml.io/) installed and configured in your environment.

### [MLFlow Integration](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/experiment-trackers/mlflow)

- For remote tracking, check [here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/tutorials/remote-server.html).

```sh
# Add MLFlow to your stack
zenml integration install mlflow -y

# Regisster the MLFlow experiment tracker
zenml experiment-tracker register mlflow_experiment_tracker --flavor=mlflow

# Authentication Methods
# Create a secret called `mlflow_secret` with key-value pairs for the
# username and password to authenticate with the MLflow tracking server
zenml secret create mlflow_secret \
    --username=<USERNAME> \
    --password=<PASSWORD>

# Reference the username and password in our experiment tracker component
zenml experiment-tracker register mlflow \
    --flavor=mlflow \
    --tracking_username={{mlflow_secret.username}} \
    --tracking_password={{mlflow_secret.password}} \
    ...


# Start the MLFlow server locally
HOST="127.0.0.1"
PORT="5000"

mlflow server --host ${HOST} --port ${PORT}
```
